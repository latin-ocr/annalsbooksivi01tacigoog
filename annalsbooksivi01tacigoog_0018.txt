xiv INTRODUcrION.

events, is a more serious charge against him, but one which
we must admit to be true. But at the same time it must be
acknowledged that he carries his prejudice only into the inter-
pretation of historical facts, not into the statement of the facts
themselves. His statements constantly afford a corrective to his
judgments, and these statements have on the whole withstood
all criticism in point of accuracy. An instructive illustratiou
of this is afforded by the case of Gnaeus Piso, Books 11. and 111.
Tacitus appears himself to have believed that Piso was guilty
of the death of Germanicus, and has at any rate by his lan·
guage so completely impressed this belief upon the world, that
most historians accept it as a matter of course; but his narra-
tion of the events aflords absolutely no evidence for it.

8. The case of Tiberius differs from that of most “rehabili-
tations ” of historical characters, in the fact that there was a dis-
tinct crisis in his life, which made him a tyrant, if he was one.
If he had died in the year 29, after a reign of fifteen years,
he would have come down to posterity as one of the best of the
Roman emperors-not a faultless man, nor a faultless mler,
but a wise, sagacious, and, on the whole, humane prince. Itis
just at this date that the work of his eulogist, Velleius Patercu-
lus, closes ; and the eulogy passed upon him by this writer is
hardly stronger than the known facts up to that time warrant.
Even Tacitus, in summing up his character (Vl. 51), admits
that down to the death of his mother in ²9 he was inter bona
malaque maistres, and that he had succeeded in concealing his
faults, occultum ac subdolum fingendis virtutibus, until the death
of Drusus in ²3³

9. The event, or rather the series of events, crowded into the

years 29, 30, and 31, which formed a crisis in the life of the
unhappy emperor, was the alleged conspiracy of Agrippina and
her sons, rapidly followed by the discovery that the trusted
Sejanus was false to him, and hythe horrible revelation of the
murder of his son Drusus by Sejanus in complicity with Livia, the
wife of Drusus. Such a succession of blows as this might well
