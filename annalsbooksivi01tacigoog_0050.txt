end oi 33, and was never accused
ot usurpation tor it.

The office was created, in con·
formity with an ancient custom ol
vesting lull constitutive as well as
governmental powers in a single
man ora board‚ lor the purpose of
regulating the constitution alter the
disorders oi civil war, and this pur-
pose was expressed in the title
tri umoir reipublicae constituendae.
In like manner Sulla, alter the first
civil war, tac. 82, was made dictator
rei publicae constituendae. Asa
matter ol course, the triumvirs re·
ceived the foll imperium.

consulem se terens: implying
a certain ostentation in the use oi
the republican name.

tribunicio iure: lntr. ao. The
tribunician authority (aurumi firs-
tr'gii vocabulum, 111. 56) was given
to him B.C. 36. This was the founda-
tion of his office upon its civil side,
as the pro-consular power was upon
the military side. By it the person
oi the emperor was made inviolable,
sacrosanctus, and through the ius
auxili, which was the starting-point
ol the power of the tribunes, he
was the formal representative and
delender ol the common people,
thus continuing the traditions os the
Gracchi, Marius, and Caesar. This
office also gave authority to convoke
the Senate and the Comitia

contentum: he rejected the titles
of liugand dictator.

donis: bounties in money aod
land. (See note on divisiones
agrorum, ιο. 1.) The bounties in
land were in the form of military

colonies‚ ol which heplanted twenty·
eight in Italy, and ⁴others in ten pro-
vinces, enumeratedintbeMonumen·
tunt Ancyrauum, 5. 33. In money
he bestowed (in colonis militum
meorum), one thousand sesterces
apiece upon about tzo,ooo men, id.

annona: this refers, says Fur·
neaux, “not to the regular corn
dole [which he reduced from 200,-
000t0150,ooo] . ..but to the care-
tut organization oi the supply from
Egypt and elsewhere, and to special
distributions, gratuitous orat a price
below eost, intimes of scarcity.”
He says (Mon. Auc. 3. 1o): Con·
sul rcndecimum [uc. 23] duodecim
frumentationes frumento privatim
coempto eutensus sunt. netonius
says (Oct. 41): Frumentum . ..
saepe levissimo, interdum nullo ·
pretio admensus est. ,

senatus, etc: the asyndeton is ’
common iu such enumerations. ,

legum: ia. through his edicta .
as, magistrate, and similar decrees.

proscriptione: ol the Second
Triumvirate,afterthedeatholCresar.
Cicero lost his lile in these proscrip-
tions. Notice how fond Tacitus is os
coupling together differentconstruc·
tiens: per acies aut proscrip-
tione (lntr. 35 r). Each torm bas
a special fitness in its own case, as
frequently elsewhere.

nobilium: Cicero would proba·
