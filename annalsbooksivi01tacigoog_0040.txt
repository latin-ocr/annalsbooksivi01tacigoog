xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

lubrico paludum, in tlte slr'ppety mnrsh, 1. 65. 63 levis oohortinm,
flac light colores, 111. 39. 1.

e. The genitive of reference with adjectives is very common3
eg. furendi melior, better in pilsm'ng, 111. 74. 13 oooultos oon·
silli, reticent about plans, v1. 3¹6. 3.

f. Tacitus shares with the poets a fondness for the dative
case, especially the dative of service or purpose (very common
in the gerundive)‚ of agency, and the dative as substituted for
ad with the accusative3 thus we find it not infrequently as end
of motion 3 eg. Gaius Oeesnr componendae Armeniae deligitur,
Gaius Caesaris selected to put in order flu affairs os Armenia,
11. 4. 2 3 qui tributo ederent, who had come for tribute, 1v. 72.
5 3 oleris scriptoribus, by renowned wn‘tcrs, 1. 1. 43 centurionem
morti dependi, it [the legion] demands llic centun'on to put him
to death, Ι. 23. 67 altine coniectantibus, in tlte eye of thore who
would sce under the sursacc, Ι. 32. 77 peni firmator. confirmer
ep‘peacc, 11. 46. 6.

g. Purpose or effect is also frequently expressed by an ac-

intentantes, oensem discordiae, threatcning wilh their hand, a
cause os ai'scord, I. 27. ι.

h. The use of the accusative, ablative, and locative to express
local relations of rest or of motion to or froin a place, used reg-
ularly only with towns and small islands, is extended by the
poete and by Tacitus to the largest islands, and even to coun-
tries, and other names of places 3 cg. remeantem Armenia, on
Itis way home from Armenio, Ι. 3. 33 Aegyptum proficiscitur,
he proceeds to Egypt, II. 59. 13 campo aut litore, on plain or
shore, IV. 74. 6.

i. In the use of prepositions his fondness for figurative ex-
pressions is very marked3 ag. apud for cum, and in the sense
of ‘in' 3 inter like an ablative absolute ora clause 3 citra for
sine (not in the Annals); circa and super, meaning “in re·
spect to” 3 per, to denote manner 3 alento, to denote resem-
blance 3 in, to express purpose or result 3 ag. opud Nolam, at
