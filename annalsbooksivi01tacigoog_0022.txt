tion ol facts, although unsound and prejudiced in explaining χ
them, marks clearly enough (VI. 51) the stages of this deterio- ,
ration. ¹

14. Is we read impartially the account of the treason trials s
under Tiberius, it is plain that 'ttbo in the second book, Silanus
in the third, and even Cremutius Cordus aud Sabinus in the
fourth, were justly punished ; while in the miserable affair oi
Piso the emperor acted with dignity and moderatiori. But
lrom the death of Drusus (tv. 8, ar). ²3) we mark a gradual
change; the emperor is no less just, and perhaps no less mer·
cisul, bnt appears suspicions and ungenerous towards the family
of Germanicus (IV. 12), and gradually develops moodiness and
bitterness ol temper. This is especially apparent atter he was
made acquainted with the lampoonsos Votienus (am. 25, IV. 42),
which appear to have wounded deeply his proud and sensitive
nature. The breach with Agrippina the next year (IV. 53),
joined with the solicitations os Sejanus, prompted him to with- ·
“ draw into that sullen seclusion with which his name is most
familiarly associated. But. even now, while we cannot aequit
him os undue suspiciousness and cruelty, he cannot, at least
until after the sall os Sejanus, be charged with positive injustice3
his victims appear to have been guilty, even is their punishment
was excessive. This deterioration ol character showed itsell
also in other acts. In the early years of his reign he would not
have been a party to the trick by which the condemnation oi
Sabinus was secured (IV. 68) 3 his interserente with the action
of the senate (VI. 3) is not aster the model of his conduct on
assuming the throne (see 1. 25); his greediness ior gain (VI.
19) is in painiul contrast with his earlier freedom from covet-

ousness (11. 483 III. 18) ; while his violent and public abuse
os Agrippina and her son Drusus (VI. 25, 24) shows the total
loss of the dignified reticence which had once characterized him.
Even the infamous delator Fulcinius Trio could charge upon
him, fluxam senio mentem (vt. 38),and the words attributed
to Arruntius, cum Tiberim post tantam rerum expm‘cntiam vi
