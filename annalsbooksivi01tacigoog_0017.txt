CHARACTER OF TIBERIUS. xiii

TrnaRmS.

6. It is from this history of the reign of Tiberius, supported
as it is in most particulars hy the testimony of Suetonius and
Dio Cassius, that the accepted view of the character of this
emperor, as a gloomy and suspicions tyrant, has been derived.
This is the view presented by, I believe, all the historians who
have treated of this period except Merivale, and by all the edi-
tors except Fumeaux. Merivale and F umeaux, in part at least,
reject the traditional view. Mommsen also, wherever he has
occasion to speak ,of Tiberius, mentions him with respect, giv-

ing him the highest praise as a ruler and not condemning him
severely as a man. The first attempt of any importance to
vindicate the character of the emperor was made by Dr. Sievers
in two Hamburg school programmes of 1850 and 1851. He was

soon followed by Adolf Stahr, who, in a series of able works, has ⁸

made himself the foremost German champion of Tiberius, the
latest of these is Tacims’ Geschichtc der Regierung des Kaisers
liberius, zibersetrt und erklc'z'rt von Adop‘ Stahr (Berlin, 187 ).
In the same line is Ii'bm'us und Tacitus von L. Freytog (Ber-
lin, 1870). Tiberius has also been defended in England hy
Prof. E. S. Beesly in Catilina, Clodius, and Iiben'us (London,
1878); and in this country by Prof. Fred. Huidelroper, in a
chapter of Judatltm at Rome (New York, 1876).

7. The modern fashion of whitewashing the disreputable
characters of history is one with which 1 have little sympathy,
except so far as it must be admitted that no man is wholly bad,
as no man is wholly good. Neither can I agree at all with
those who would defend Tiberius by depreciating the motives
of his historiari. That Tacitus sympathized with Germanicus
and Agrippina, as against Tiberius, is no doubt tme; it was his ,
right as a patriot and an historian to choose his side. That he
constantly imputes to Tiberius sentiments and motives for which
the narrative gives no evidence, thus carrying his preconceived
theories and prejudices into the interpretation of historical
