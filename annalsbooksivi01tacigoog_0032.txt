made between divus Augustus and the reigning emperor, who
also was lawlully known as Augustus.¹

26. It was a matter os course that some of the sacredness
os the present deity attached to the members oi his family.
Augustus, as adopted son of Julius Caesar, called himself Diui
filius ,· and it may be that here is found in part the explana-
tion os the contempt which Julia, daughter oi Augustus, felt
lor her husband Tiberius (I. 53), ior Tiberius was not as yet
adopted into the imperial family.

The relations between the several members oi this family are
shown in the table on page xxix. The following (besides
Tiberius) appear prominently in the Annals:

a. Livia, the mother ol the emperor, was a woman oi great personal
beauty, and an ambitious, domineering spirit; apparently not one who
would scruple long at any means to secure her ends. She exercised a great
ascendeney over her husband, and expected to exercise the same over her
son; and nothing in the history oi Tiberius is more noteworthy than the
effort he made to preserve the due balance between the dutiiul affection
ior his mother, characteristic oi Roman family life, and his determination
to keep the reins oi government in his own hands (see I. 723 II. 345 III.
17.64; lV. 57; V. r).

incidente in the narration. If he had lived, it seems certain that he would
have been an able and energetic ruler3 but the sternness oi temper which
in Tiberius developed into cruelty only at the very close oi his lise, was a
predominant characteristic ol his son from the first, and would probably
have made him a tyrant.

d. Agrippina, daughter ol Marcus Agrippa and Julia, and wiie ol
Germanicus. Α woman of high spirit 3ηά ambition, and oi unblemished
personal character. It is impossible ior usto know whether her ambition
