unsettle the moral nature of a young man, how is it with a man
of seventy? Professor Beesly puts the case sorcibly and conclu-
sively, as against the imputed change in the character of Tiberius
. aiter assuming the purple at fifty-six, against the assumption os
Tacitus that a man egregius vita famaque, quoad pubertas vel in
imperiis sub Augusto suit, all at once became a hypocrite and a
tyrant. “I would put it to you, have you in your own experi-

attractive characteristicS, especially when they were contrasted
with the popular manners and sunny disposition of his brother
Drusus and nephew Germanicus. It may readily be believed
that the morbid tendencies of his nature were increased when,
on the command os Augustus, he was obliged to put away his
much-loved wife Vipsania and marry the haughty and licen-
tious Julia, who disliked and despised him. In a fit oi moody
impatience and disgust he withdrew from the court, and lived
in retirement several years at Rhodes ; and this episode, too,
may well have developed still further the unamiable side os his
nature. And yet Augustus, alienated from him for a time,
recalled him to Rome, and designated him as his successor
