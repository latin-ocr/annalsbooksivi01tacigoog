pletium agitaretur3 dein rogatione tribunicia ad semun-
cias redactum, postremo vetita versura. Multisque4
plebis scitis obviam itum fraudibus, quae totiens re·
pressae miras per artes rursum oriebantur. Sed tum 5
Gracchus praetor, cui ea quaestio evenerat, multitudine
periclitantium subactus rettulit ad senatum, trepidique
patres (nequeenim quisquam tali culpa vacuus) veniam
a principe petivere; et concedente annus in posterum
sexque menses dati, quis secundum iussa legis rationes
familiares quisque componerent. Hinc inopia rei num· 17
mariae, commoto simul omnium aere alieno, et quia tot ’
damnatis bonisque eorum divenditis signatum argentum
fisco vel aerario attinebatur. Ad hoc senatus praescrip 2

rate was for the old year of ten
months, which would be ten per
cent for the year of twelve months.
By the law presently referred tn, it
was reduced to half this rate.

rogatione tribunicia: this was
nc. 34.

vetifa versura: probably by the
Genucian Law, nc, 342, ne same·
rare liceret (Liv. Vll. 42. ι). Ver-
sura is not equivalent to usura
(interest), bnt means rather the
making of a ioan—borrowing from
one person to pay a debt to another.
What was prohibited therefore was
not the taking ‘interest at all, but
the trade of money-lending (sarne-
rare). In the present ease, at any
rate, it is evident that the law did
not forbid interest, for in the next
chapter it is said that the hundred
million sesterces advanced by the
emperor were as a favor loaned
without interest (sine usuris), from
which it follows that it would have
been lawful to exact interest.

4. fraudibus: eg. just after the
Second Punic War, loans were
made in the name of socii, or citi·

zens of allied towns(Liv. XXXV. 7).

5. tum, on tlte present occasion.

ea quaestio: the court which
had cognizance of this offenee.

trepidi patres: in violating this
law the senators likewise offended
against the public sentiment which
forbade them to engage in trade.

concedente: Intr. 35 o.

secundum, eto: ae. arrange ’
their business so as to conform to
the law.

⁴ 17. rei nummariae, cosh-

there being no money but coin,
nummus,· ef. rei frumentariae, 13.
2.

commoto: ia. being called in;
this made an enorrnous demand for
ready money, while the extensive
confiscations had locked up large
sums in the treasury.

2. ad hoc, to meet etis emergency,
-anunusualmeaningofthisphrase,
but supported by the expression of
Suetonius who (Tib. 48), in de·
scribing the mensures now taken,
adds: nec res expediretur,· from
which we understand that the
measure aimed to relieve from em·
barrassmeuts‚ but failed, as we see
further on to have been the case.
