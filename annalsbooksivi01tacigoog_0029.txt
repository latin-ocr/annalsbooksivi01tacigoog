22. Besides the emperor, there was uo real possessor ol
power except the senate. The people, the ultimate source of
authority in the Republic, were stripped of all effective share in

the government3 the emperor, by virtue of his tribunician
power, may be regarded as embodying iu himself the popular
element of the constitution. The elections of magistrates were
now mostly transferred to the senate (I. 15), while the edicts
of the princeps and, by degrees, the ordinances of the senate

curatores, appointed by him and responsible solely to him;
and it followed as a matter of course that these officcrs soon
crowded the regular magistrates out of the chief part of their

emperor, concurrently with the quaestiones perpetuae, presided
over by the praetors; but his authority was not long in super-

century had disappeared entirely. The praetors who exercised
