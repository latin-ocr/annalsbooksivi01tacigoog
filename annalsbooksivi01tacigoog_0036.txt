³0· As to syntactical changes, it is enough to quote Driger’s
remark in relation to the history of the Latin language, that
“in the course ol nearly eight hundred years it experienced
relatively slight changes in its' grammatical construction.” A
few such changes will be pointed out in the notes.

31. The larger part os the peculiarities ol Tacitus are his
own, not those of his age. He has the characteristics of his
age, but they are so inconspicuous in comparisou with his indi-
vidual characteristics as to be almost obscured ς he is hardly

points to present both sides impartially, but to present his own
side3 and when his own mind was made up, he could not see
