not without expressions, at the same time, which showed that he
recognized in him dangerous elements ol character. Tiberius
himself seems to have been sully aware of the presence os these
evil impulses in his nature, and shrank with what we have no
right to call an insincere reluctance from the assumption ol
absolute power. And yet, during the fifteen years from his
accession to his retirement at Capri, it is hard to point out
a single act oi his which was manifestly unjust and cruel. So

victims, spread over the space os six years, does not alter all

and Cremutius Cordus (IV. 34) may be excused, and perhaps
justified ; but itis none the less true that lrom this time the
