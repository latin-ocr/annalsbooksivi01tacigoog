xxiv INTRODUCl'lON.

tribunicia potestas, which was conferred upon him ior life, aud
gave him the powers os the tribunate without the limitations to
which this magistracy was subject. The tribunician power,
making his person sacred, giving him an unlimited right to
prohibit the actions os other magistrates, and making him ina
'peculiar sense the representative oi the people, was the con-
’ summation of his authority, being always bestowed after the
proconsular power. As ponnyex maximus too he possessed
the entire control ol the organized religion os the state, and
the essential powers os the censorship were placed in his
hands under the title regimen morum. The title which de·
scribed the emperor as the possessor os this bundle os powers,
military and civil, was princeps,l prince 3 and this is the term
usually employed by Tacitus. ,

21. All the powers thus gathered in the hands os the prince
were recognized powers os Roman magistrates. The Empire
as a system os govemment did not, in its first years, contain a
single principle which had not already existed under the Repub
lic. What was novel was the combining oi all these powers in
the hands os one rnan as a permanent possession. The prince
was a magistrate, created by law, aud amenable to law3 the
new magistracy fitted perfectly into the republican scheme.
But it was an assemblage os powers so extraordinary and
controlling that its possessor was in practice raised sar above
every other person or body ol persons in the state. (See the
interesting letter of Tiberius, III. 53.) It may be compared to
the dictatorship os the early Republic, which consisted in the
bestowal os extraordinary power upon one man, to meet an
extraordinary crisis. The crisis had now become chronic, and
the dictatorship was made permanent. (See Seeley's first lecture
on Roman Imperialism.)

1 This title oi prince is usually associated with the republican dignity
os princeps senatus. According to Mommsen, however (Riimisches staats-
recht, 11. 734), be was rather chief ol the citizens, der gewicktrgste und
angesehenste Br'e'rger‚· the title princeps senatus was never given to the
emperor until the time oi Pertinax (id, 111. 971).
