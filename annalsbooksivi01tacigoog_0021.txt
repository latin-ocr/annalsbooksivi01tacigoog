REIGN OF TERROR· xvii

free expression of thought is silenced, and creative literature is
at an end.

12. The explanation of the change is, Ι believe, to be found
in a morbid apprehension of danger by which his mind was at
this time mastered. The plots against his life and crown and
the stability of his household,--which he believed without
question, whether on good grounds or not,-seem to have
thrown him into an unreasoning panic, in which he struck
wildly at all from whom his distempered fancy apprehended
danger. His was a nature prone to panic, lacking in sels-reli-

stories of cruelty and tyranny are fahe or exaggerated3 it is not

character was concealed under a cloak of hypocrisy until this age,
and that then for the first time he showed himself as he really

was. Itis not necessary, however, to suppose that his character
was radically changed, but its unamiable side may have received
a sudden and abnormal development from the shocks given to
his moral nature. Not so sudden, however, but that we can
trace his deterioration for some years before he became thor-
oughly demoralized. Tacitus himself, accurate in the observa-
