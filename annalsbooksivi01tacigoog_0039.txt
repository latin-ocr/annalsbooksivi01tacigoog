for concrete, or in the plural, thus turning thern into concretes.
This is one of the usages which mark most distinctly the transi-
tion to modern turns of expression5 for one of the chief points
of difference between the ancients and moderns consists in the
choice of concrete and abstract forms of speech; egumenus,
sc. miles, tlte solalers of tlte ninrt legion, Ι. 3ο. 4; matrimonio
oo peouniat hostium, tlte wives and moneys of tlte enemy, ΙΙ. 13.
3 ; qui infamias subiere, who undantem infamy [ou different
occasions], IV. 33. 4.

Sometimes on the other hand, Tacitus uses a concrete ex·
pression where we should expect an abstract 3 cg. specio raou-
santis‚ with a show os rq'ecting, Ι. 3. a, where the participle
serves the purpose of a gerund.

b. The use of simple verbs where the prose writers em-
ployed compounds is especially characteristic of the Annats.
The greater precision of the compounds fitted them for the
uses of prose speech, while the poets, whom Tacitus here imi·
tates, appear to have found a certain‘freedom and picturesque·
ness in the simple forms: eg. posuit for proposuit, putsorth,
I. 7. 5; verse soraterra, overturned, 11.42. 4 3 firmabat for
confirmabat, strengthencd, 1. 71. 5.

Compound verbs are often used with an accusative where
the rule would require a preposition or a dative ; cg. pugnam
ant rinouls elapsi, having escapcdfivm battle or prison, Ι. 61. 6.

c. Also horrowed from the poets is the frequent omission of
the copula. A characteristic illustration of this is found in the

second chapter of the first book, where postquam is followed by
arma [crant], oppressus [est] and reliquus [erat].

d. The construction of the partitive genitive is carried toa
great length, particularly as depending upon abstract nouns or
the neuter (usually plural) of adjectives used abstractly, and
even masculine and feminine adjectives3 ag. uligines paludum,
marshyswamps,1. 17. 5 ; subioota vallium, tlte vallcys below, 1.
65. 1; (but prominentiamontium, tlte spurs os tlte mountains,
II. 16. 23) taoitn suspicionum, silent suspicions, IV. 41. 13
