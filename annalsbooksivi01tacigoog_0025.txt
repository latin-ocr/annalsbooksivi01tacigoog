PROVINCES OF THE EMPIRE. xxi

ernors sent from Rome with absolute authority over all provin-
cials, it is to be understood, however, that within the borders
os nearly every province there were not only communities os
Roman citizens, but also cities and principalities which had re-
tained their nominal independence as allies os the Roman peo-
ple, and that neither ol these classes was in law subject to the
governor. During the reign of Tiberius the number os provinces
was increased to thirty by the annexation of Cappadocia, and
the division oi Germany into Upper and Lower. Os the twenty-
eight provinces, eleven were govemed, aster the method os the
Republic, by proconsuls commissioned by the senate 3 one,
Egypt, was in strictness of speech not a province at all, but a
kingdom, of which the emperor was king3 the other sixteen
were placed under 'the immediate govemment of the emperor,
who administered them by deputies, legati, clothed with com-
plete govemmental authority, as his representatives, or by fiscal
agents, procuratores.
