SACRED CHARAcr ER OF THE EMPEROR. xxvii

lost much of its vitality, it is not strange that the worship of
Augustus rapidly became the most wide-spread aud popular
cult within the bouuds of the empire. 'Augustus during his
lifetime, shrank from a thorough-going acceptance of the divine
honors offered to him, and required them to be associated with
the Genius of Rome. After his death his worship was cele-

here a touch of sarcasm), Vespasian and Titus; also upon some
female members of their families. Each consecrated emperor
had his flamen or special priest, and for their worship special
colleges were organized. The first establishment of such a
college is described in the present work (1. 54) 3 its members,
at first called Sedulus Augustales, were known as Augustales
Claudiales after the cult of the emperor Claudius was joined
with that of Augustus.l 'lhe worship of the emperor rapidly
