xii INTRODUCHON.

century transcripts, The extant portions ol the larger works
are contained in two manuscripts os the ninth, tenth, or eleventh
century, one-(the First Medicean) containing the four first
books os the AnnaLr with what remains os the fifth and sixth‚
the other (the Second Medicean) the remaining portion of the
Annali (Books XI. to XVI.) with the Historias. These manu-
scripts were brought from ¹Germany to Italy, and are now in the
Medicean Library os F lorence. Τὴε latter portion was printed
in 1470 ; the earlier portion, that contained in the present
edition, was brought to Rome in 1508, and printed by ordesos
Pope Leo X. in 15 5.

5. The form of the Annali is, as the name indicates, strictly
chronological. The events ol each year are told by themselves,
so that any independent series os events can be read in connec-
tion only by taking in succession several detached passages3 to
this rule there are but one or two exceptions (ag. VI. 31-37).
As has been already said, the extant portions ol the work con-
sist of two distinct parts, separated bya gap os four books.
This gap covers the reign of Caligula and most of that of
Claudius (A.D. 37 to 54), while the two extant portions com-
prise the reigns of Tiberius and Nero respectively. The
accounts os these two reigns are preserved nearly complete.
The present edition contains the first part, the reign os Tibe-
rius, comprising the first six books, ol which, however, nearly
the whole os the fifth book and perhaps a quarter ol the sixth
are missing. The missing portions contained the year 30 with
the greater part of 29 and 31, the reign of Tiberius extending
srorn nn. 14 to 37. In biographical importance, for estimating
the character ol Tiberius, and understanding the puzzling events
os the closing years ol his reign, these lost parts ol the work
must have ranked among the very highest, sor they contained
an account of the destruction os the family of Germanicus and

’ the downlall os Sejanus.
