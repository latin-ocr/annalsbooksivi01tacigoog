Paurasson Arnurv died very suddenly at his home in Madison,
Wisconsin‚ December 9,1889. The Introduction to this vol·
ume, the Latin text and the commentary were already in type,
and now appear, in their characteristic features, essentially as
he left them. The indexes were in manuscript and unfinished,
but they have been completed in accordance with his intention.

Professor Allen’s long and successful experience as a college
teacher, his intimate acquaintance with Roman history, and
the fascination which he felt in the study of Tacitus and of the
character of Tiberius in particular, gave him exceptional quali·

him with unusual confidence. His interest in the College
Series had been intelligent and helpful, and the editors feel his
death as a serious personal loss. In a wider view, his great
attainments in several fields of research, his catholic tastes and
interests, the openness and alcrtuess of his mind, his joyous
readiness in communicating his acquisitions, and the genuine
modesty and nobility of his character made him a permanent
honor to scholarship and to life.

The text of this volume is based upon that of Halm's fourth
edition of Tacitus (Leipsic, 1882). Deviations from this
standard consist largely in a closer adherence to the readings
of the manuscript. The most important variants are discussed
in the Appendix. The orthography of Halm's edition is that
of the Medicean manuscript3 for the purposes of this edition
it has seemed better to adopt, though not with painful consis-
tency, the best-established results of specialists in this field,-
