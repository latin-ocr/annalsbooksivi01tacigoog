t. Many words are used only by Tacitus, and others only by
him in a certain meaning, eg. finire, die, VI. 50. 93 inturbidus,
unrtltsturbcd, 111. 52· 1 3 circumflui, surroundcd by, VI. 37. 4.

As the style of Tacitus exaggerates all the characteristics ol
the Latinity ol the Silver Age, so his style in the Annolr, his
latest work, pushes his own peculiarities to their extreme. It
-is in this work that his harshness and crabbedness of style are
found in their fullest development. Some sentences seemlike
mere strings os disconnected wordS, the relation ol which to
one another can only be discovered by assiduous study and
analysis. The Annals stands to the Dialogus, in respect to
style, very much as Carlyle's Fredetick tlte Great to his Lty‘e o]
Sterling. ’
