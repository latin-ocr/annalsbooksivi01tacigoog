notably, of Brambach. A full Index os Names and an Index
to the Notes will, it is hoped, add to the usesulness os the book.

As the commentary assumes that the reader is at a somewhat
advanced point in his Latin studies, little attention is paid to
the commonplaces of grammar ; on the other hand, consider·
able prominence is given to the idiosyncracies os Tacitus'
Latinity, and to the changes which the language had under-
gone since the Ciceronian period. A leading aim in the com·
mentary is to present a connected view of the character and
reign of Tiberius, and to trace the constitutional and adminis-
trative changes which took place under that emperor. To
make the view more complete, the lost portions os the fifth
and sixth Books have been, in a measure, supplied by extracta
from Dio Cassius, Suetonius, and Juvenal.

The long and concentrated study of Tacitus has accumulated
a rich store os illustrative material that is now the common
property of scholarship. This material has been freely used for
the present edition, but special acknowledgment is due for aid
derived from the editions of Furneaux (Clarendon PresS, Oxford,
1884), Nipperdey (8th edition, by Andresen, Berlin, 1884),
Driiger (4th edition, Leipsic, 1882), and Plitzner (Gotha, 1884),
and also from Drager's Synna und Stil des Tacitus (3d ed,
Leipsic, 1882), and Gerber and Greel's Lexicon Tact'teum
(A-M, Leipsic, 1877-88). ln the discussion of constitu-
tional and antiquarian questions Mommsen's labors have been
ol great service 3 Marquardt and Madvig have also been fre-
quently consulted. Indebtedness to other recent works and
monographs is acknowledged at the pertinent points in the
Introduction and the notes.
