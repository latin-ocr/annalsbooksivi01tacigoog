now, always prove his point. In this, as we have said, there
appears no trace ol insincerity, no attempt to conceal or distort
the facts. But his conception oi the duties of an historian
was that of his own age, different from ours. Icannot agree
with the special defendens of Tiberius, who act as if the only
way to vindicate their hero was to impugn the motives of his
