space iu his works have an individuality of character which
seems to pervade all their words 3ηά actions. We know thern
as if we had lived with them.”

34. This dominant characteristic as au historian serves to
explain one of his most conspicuous characteristics os style, -
fondness for poetical words and phrases, and especially his
close relation to Vergil. Vergil, too, was awriter of a lofty
ethical tone, and was evidently a favorite with Tacitus, who, as
has been often pointed out, copies freely his phrases and tums
of speech. So marked is his predilection for poetical words
and phrases, that it is hard to say whether his style borrows
more from the poets or from the habits of speech of the foren-
sic orator. On the whole, it is only in his diction that he has
horrowed from the poets 3 his abruptness and compression of
style, his sententiousness and eamestness, are qualities that he
has brought from the court-mom. This explains a tendemess
of feeling which often goes to the length of sentimentality ; in
treating of Tiberius, for example, he persistently depicts stern
justice as harshnesS, economy as niggardliness (ΙΙ. 38), modesty
as meanness of spirit (IV.' 38), and a peaceful and sellcontained ·
policy as a degenerate temper (11. 26; IV. 3²)·

35. The grammatical and stylistic peculiarities of Tacitus are
for the most part such as show the influence ol the poets on
the working of a poetic temperament. If, as has been said
above, the student who passes from Cicero to Tacitus meets
with much that is strange and difficult, the student of Vergil
finds himself often on familiar ground. Most of these peculi·
arities will be pointed out in the notes ; but it will be of service
to enumerate here a few of the most striking and characteristic
of them, passing over in general those which may be called reg-
ular if unusual forms of expression. It should be noted that

Ι most of the usages here pointed out are rather characten'stz'cs

-than peculian'ties of Tacitus ; that is, they are found also in

other writers, but are especially common with him.
