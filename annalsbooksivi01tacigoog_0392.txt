of the crowd, turned aside through the street which led to the prison, and,
as they descended the steps1 down which condemned criminals are wont
to be hurled‚ stumbled and fell. And as he was taking the auspices after
this, no bird of good omen made its appearance, but ravens in great
numbers hovering and crawling about him fiew to the prison and perched
upon it.

6. Tbese signs, however, neither Sejanus nor any one else took to
heart; for even if some god had foretold clearly the change of fortune
that was shortly to take place. no one would have believed it. 'lherefore
they continued without stint to swear by his fortune, and to call him the
colleague of Tiberius, having in mind not merely the consulship, but the

. imperial dignity. But nothing which happened to him escaped the knowl-
edge of Tiberius; and he, consulting in his own mind how he might
destroy him, and finding no way to do this openly without peril, hit upon
a remarkable plan for learning accurately not only his sentiments, but also
those of others. He wrote continually and at great length a variety of
things about himself both to Seianus and the senate, at one time say-
ing that he was very ill, and could not last much longer, and at another
time that he was in excellent health, and was intending shortly to come
to Rome. And Sejanus himself he now praised to the skies, and again
depreciated very much, and honored some of his companions and dis-
graced others on his account, so that Sejanus, being by turns filled with
yanity and with dread, was always in a state of suspense. For it did not
occur to him (being still treated with distinction) to apprehend any
danger,-which might have set him to excite a rebellion,—nor on the
other hand to be emboldened to take some decisive step, for he was con·
stantly losing in consideration. And at the same time all others, hearing
at short intervals first one story and then just the opposite, and feeling
seeure neither in admiring Sejanus notin despising him, constantly expect-
ing too to hear that Tiberius was dead or that he was on his way to the
city, were kept in equal uncertainty.

7. Now Sejanus was disturbed by these things, and all the more because
first a great cloud of smoke arose from one of his statues, and when
the head was removed in order to see what was the cause, a great snake
crawled out of ir; and when another head had been placed upon it, and
he was about to offer sacrifice to himself (for he sacrificed to himself as

well as to the gods),a rope was found twisted about the neck. And a ¹
statue of Fortune, which had, as men believed, belonged to Servius Tullius, ¹

who had once been king in Rome, and which now Seianus bad iu his

nus, came down by the right, about where the Via del Campidoglio now is.
