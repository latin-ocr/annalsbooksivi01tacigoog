Hic rerum urbanarum status erat, cum Pannonicas ld

tionibus ac precibus sordidis).
te‘nuit: sc. ius. ’

plures . . . candidatos: sc.
praeturae. Tbese were called can·
dilati Caesaris. The conmendatio
sine repulsa et ambitu was equiva-
lent to an appointment, and grew
out of the formal and official su ra·
galia, or personal canvassing o the
republic. Augustus had continued
the republican form ol suffragatio .·
tribus curn candidatis suis circumi-
bat, supplicabatque errare sollemni

triumphali veste: theloga picra, ·

embroldered with gold, and the

tunica palmata, embroidered with Α

palm leaves in gold.

curru vehi: this honor belonged.
to the praetors, to whom the trlb·=
