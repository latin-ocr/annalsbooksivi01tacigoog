WORKS OF TACITUS. xi

Augusti, serving as an introduction to the Histon’es, in the
author’s most mature style, and generally regarded as his mas·
terpiece. It was in sixteen books, oi which about one-third,
the central portion of the work, is lost.

It may be estimated roughly that about one-third ot' the
writings os Tacitus is extant.

4. The reputation oi Tacitus during his own liietime, both
as an historian and an orator, was very high. Pliny says of him
(Il.11, 17) that, when engaged in the prosecution oi a cruel
and unjust governor, he spoke eloquentissime et, quad eximiam
arationi eius inest, σεμνῶς, which last word we may render,
‘in a stately, earnest style! Again, in mentioning Tacitus as
delivering the funeral oration at the death oi the distinguished
Verginius Rufus, he says (II. r): tlic stapremus felicitati eius
cumulus accessit, laudator eloquentissimus. In another letter
(IX. 23) he tells of a conversation held by Tacitus with a

chance acquaintance, who asked him aster some talk on literary

subjects, Tacitus es an Pliniust-a coupling oi names which
delighted Pliny exceedingly. But during the Middle Ages the
name oi Tacitus sell into oblivion, and his works seemed entirely
lost. In the revival of learning some portions os his writings
were rescued. In November, 1425, the distinguished scholar
and discoverer of manuscripts, Poggio Braccioliui, received a
letter from Germany in which was mentioned the discovery oi
alr'qua opera Cornelii Taciti nabis ignota. But much corre-
spondence and inquiry failed to bring the book, and Poggio
died in 1459 without sight oi the much desired treasme. Soon
after, however, the manuscript, containing the Dialogus, the
Germania, and awork of Suetonius, was brought to Italy. The
Aga'cola was discovered at about the same time3 but the origi-
nal manuscripts disappeared shortly after being copied, so that
of these smaller works oi Tacitus we have nothing but fifteenth

have been used by itselt' through a misunderstanding. 1t may be noted
that Tacitus himself (IV. 32, 1) speaks of the work as annales.
