Tamum.

r. Very little is known of the lise or personality os the
historian Tacitus. Even his name is matter os doubt. Heis
commonly spoken os without praenomen, as Cornelius Taci-

younger Pliny, who was born am. 61 or 62, says (Epp. VII. κο)

career. He says os himself (Hisa l. r) that his course ot'
