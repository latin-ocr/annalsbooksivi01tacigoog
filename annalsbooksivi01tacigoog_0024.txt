xx INTRODUCl'ION.

the plebs served to a certain extent as prosecuting officersin
offences 01 a pohtical characte15but ordinary crimes, and,
aller the establishment 01 the quaestiones perpetuae by Sulla, all
classes 01 crimes, were lest to the interest or public spirit 01
individuals. 11 individuals did not take them up, they went
unpunished. Hence the dangerous resource 01 invitingindi·
viduals to search out and indict criminals, by rewarding thern
